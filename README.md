# Dockerfile for OwnTracks Recorder
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/deisi/docker-ot-recorder.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/deisi/docker-ot-recorder)

Dockerfile for the [Recorder](https://github.com/owntracks/recorder) of the
Owntracks project.

## Quickstart
```bash
$ docker volume create recorder_store
$ docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v recorder_store:/store -e OTR_HOST=mqtt_broker owntracks/recorder
```

Recorder is now accessible at http://localhost:8083

`-p 8083:8083` makes the container reachable at port 8083. `-d` detaches the
container into the background. The volume `recorder_store` is mounted at
`/store` into the container. This is needed to have persistent data storage.
`-e` allows to pass additional configuration to the container as
environment variables. Multiple `-e` parameters can be used for multiple
environment variables.

## Configuration
The Recorder can be configured using two methods, environment variables and
via the a `recorder.conf` file in the `/config` volume of the container.

### Environment variables
Can be passed to the container with the `-e` parameter. Example:
```bash
$ docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -e OTR_HOST=mqtt_broker -e OTR_PORT=1883 -e OTR_USER=user -e OTR_PASS=pass owntracks/recorder
```

The complete list of parameters can be found in the [recorder
documentations](https://github.com/owntracks/recorder/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file)

### Configuration file
One can also use a configuration file. The container reads a `recorder.conf`
file from the `/config` folder. To use this, create a folder e.g. `./config` and
mount it into you docker container at `/config`.

```bash
$ mkdir config
$ docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v recorder_store:/store -v ./config:/config owntracks/recorder
```

Up on starting the recorder, a default `recorder.conf` file will be created if
none exists. Possible options are documented
[here](https://github.com/owntracks/recorder/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file**

**Notes:**
- `OTR_HOST` is as seen from the container. Thus `localhost` refers to
the container not the host.
- Environment variables, overwrite the `recorder.conf` file options.
- The shell like style of the`recorder.conf` file needs "" encapsulated
variable values.

## Storing data
The `/store` volume of the container is used for persistent storage of location
data. The volume needs to be created explicitly.

```bash
$ docker volume create recorder_storage
$ docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v recorder_store:/store owntracks/recorder
```
It is also possible to use a local folder instead of an static docker volume.

```bash
$ mkdir store
$ docker run -d -p 8083:8083 -v ./store:/store owntracks/recorder
```

If nothing is mounted at `/store`, docker will create a unique volume
automatically. However up on recreation of the docker container, this process
will be repeated and another unique volume will be created. As a result, the
container will have forgotten about previous tracks.

## TLS between MQTT broker and Recorder
The `OTR_CAPATH` of the container defaults to the `/config` volume. Thus
certificates and key files belong into the `/config` volume. `OTR_CAFILE` must be configured for TLS.

`OTR_CERTFILE` defaults to `cert.pem` and `OTR_KEYFILE` to `key.pem`. These files are optional and the options are ignored if the files don't exist.

## TLS encryption via reverse proxy

The Recorder has no encryption module by it self. Instead use a reverse proxy
setup. See https://github.com/jwilder/nginx-proxy for how to do this in a semi
automatic way with docker containers and
https://github.com/owntracks/recorder#reverse-proxy for Recorder specific
details.

## Docker compose files
Save a file with the name `docker-compose.yml` and following content. Run with
`docker-compose up` from the same folder.

``` yaml
version: '3'

services:

  otrecorder:
    image: owntracks/recorder
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    volumes:
      - config:/config
      - store:/store
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  store:
  config:

```

This `docker-compose.yml` file creates `store` and `config` volumes. It is
possible to edit the `recorder.conf` file in the `config` volume to get the
system up and running. It is also possible to pass environment variables to the
docker container via the `environment:` keyword. For details see
[here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/environment-variables/) and for available
variables see
[here](https://github.com/owntracks/recorder/blob/master/README.md#configuration-file).

An example might look like:

``` yaml
version: '3'

services:

  otrecorder:
    image: owntracks/recorder
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    volumes:
      - store:/store
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - OTR_HOST: "mqtt_broker"
      - OTR_USER: "user"
      - OTR_PASS: "pass"

volumes:
  store:

```

### With MQTT broker
If an mqtt broker is needed mosquitto can be used. There are ready to use
containers available on docker hub. To use `eclipse-mosquitto` add the following
to you `docker-compose.yml` file.

``` yaml
version: '3'

services:

  otrecorder:
    image: owntracks/recorder
    ports:
      - 8083:8083
    volumes:
      - config:/config
      - store:/store
    restart: unless-stopped

  mosquitto:
    image: eclipse-mosquitto
    ports:
      - 1883:1883
      - 8883:8883
    volumes:
      - mosquitto-data:/mosquitto/data
      - mosquitto-logs:/mosquitto/logs
      - mosquitto-conf:/mosquitto/config
    restart: unless-stopped

volumes:
  store:
  config:
  mosquitto-data:
  mosquitto-logs:
  mosquitto-conf:
```
See [here](https://hub.docker.com/_/eclipse-mosquitto) for info on the eclipse-mosquitto image and how to configure.


# Notes
- ~~certificates volume for Recorder and some documentation~~
- ~~Check if lua5.2-libs is needed~~
- ~~Check if eclipse-mosquitto is working~~
- Maybe put the most common mosquitto options
- Maybe add letsencrypt
- ~~Add some defaults so mosquitto and owntracks work right away~~
- Find out how it works with automatic build tags on travis and automatic docker hub uploading
